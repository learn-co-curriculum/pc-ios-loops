#Loops

##Some extra practice with loops:


**1) Use a for loop to print the integer values 1 to 10 on the screen
**
	12345678910



**2) The even/odd reporter**

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").



**3) Use a nested while loop to reproduce the following output
**

```
	1
	
	22
	
	333
	
	4444
	
	55555
```


**4) Try to write code that generates the following output:
**

```
	    1
       121
      12321
     1234321
    123454321
     1234321
      12321
       121
        1
```
